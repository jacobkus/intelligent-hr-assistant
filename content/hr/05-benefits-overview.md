# Benefits Overview (Health, Dental, Vision, EAP)

## Purpose
Provide a clear, accessible summary of core employee benefits and how to use them, acknowledging local plan differences.

## Scope & Definitions
- Applies to benefits‑eligible employees; local plan documents control where differences exist.
- EAP: Employee Assistance Program providing confidential counseling and resources.

## Eligibility
- Generally begins on start date or first of the month following start, per local plan rules.
- Dependents (spouse/partner, children) may be eligible; documentation may be required.

## Entitlements / Allowances
- Health: Medical coverage via local insurers or global plans; preventive care encouraged.
- Dental & Vision: Coverage for routine and major procedures per plan summaries.
- EAP: Confidential counseling (e.g., 24/7 hotline), financial/legal resources, limited free sessions.
- Life & Disability: Basic employer‑paid coverage; optional supplemental coverage may be available.

## Enrollment & Changes
1. Enroll via the benefits portal during onboarding or the annual open enrollment period.
2. Qualifying life events (e.g., marriage, birth) allow mid‑year changes within the plan’s deadline (typically 30 days).
3. Review plan summaries and costs; select coverage tiers and dependents as applicable.

## Accessing Care
- Present your insurance ID (physical or digital) at appointments.
- Use in‑network providers to minimize out‑of‑pocket costs when applicable.
- Contact EAP directly for confidential support; HR does not receive detailed usage data.

## Claims & Reimbursements
- Follow insurer instructions for claims; keep receipts and submit promptly.
- Pre‑authorization may be required for certain procedures.

## Privacy & Data
- Medical information is confidential and handled in accordance with privacy laws and plan rules.

## Manager Responsibilities
- Direct employees to official plan documents; avoid providing medical or legal advice.
- Support time off for appointments per Sick Leave or local policy.

## Compliance & Non-Compliance
- Fraudulent claims are prohibited and may lead to disciplinary action.

## Exceptions & Escalations
- Complex cases or coverage questions should be escalated to HR Benefits and the insurer.

## FAQ
- When do benefits start? See Eligibility; often first of the month following start date.
- Can I change plans mid‑year? Only for qualifying life events within the deadline.
- Is EAP confidential? Yes; the company does not receive personal details.
