# Remote and Hybrid Work Policy

## Purpose
Provide a consistent framework for flexible work while maintaining productivity, security, and an inclusive culture across time zones.

## Scope & Definitions
- Applies to roles approved for remote or hybrid arrangements.
- Remote: Employee works primarily outside a company office.
- Hybrid: Employee splits time between office and remote locations on a regular cadence.

## Eligibility
- Role suitability is determined by business needs, collaboration requirements, and regulatory constraints.
- Employees must have reliable internet and a safe, dedicated workspace.

## Entitlements / Allowances
- Equipment: Company‑issued laptop and peripherals; additional equipment may be approved by manager and IT.
- Stipends: A modest monthly stipend may be provided for internet/electricity where permitted by local policy.
- Travel: Occasional travel to office or customer sites may be required; expenses follow the Travel & Expense policy.

## Request / Use Process
1. Discuss arrangement with your manager and confirm role suitability.
2. Submit a remote/hybrid request in the HR system, including location and working hours.
3. IT confirms security compliance; HR verifies employment law considerations for the stated location.
4. Agreement is reviewed annually or upon role change.

## Collaboration Norms
- Core collaboration hours are set by the team for at least 3 overlapping hours daily.
- Use documented channels: project tools, shared documents, and meeting notes.
- Prefer async communication and clear written updates to reduce meeting load.

## Security & Compliance
- Use only company‑managed devices with up‑to‑date security patches.
- Connect via approved VPNs; do not use public unsecured networks for confidential work.
- Follow data handling policies; prevent unauthorized access in shared living spaces.

## Health, Safety & Ergonomics
- Maintain a safe, ergonomic workspace; consult IT/Facilities for guidance.
- Report work‑related injuries immediately per local procedures.

## Manager Responsibilities
- Set clear goals, response SLAs, and collaboration norms.
- Ensure equitable access to opportunities regardless of location.

## Compliance & Non-Compliance
- Unauthorized relocation or work from unapproved countries may breach tax/immigration rules.
- Violations of security practices may lead to access restrictions or disciplinary action.

## Exceptions & Escalations
- Temporary work from another location requires prior approval from HR and Legal.
- Escalate complex cases (e.g., cross‑border) to HR for guidance.

## FAQ
- Can I work from a different country short‑term? Only with prior approval; immigration and tax rules apply.
- Are flexible hours allowed? Yes, with agreed core collaboration hours.
- Who pays for home internet? A stipend may apply where policy allows; otherwise employee covers costs.

## Revision History
- 2025-11-01: Version 1.0 – Initial remote/hybrid work policy.

## Disclaimer
This global policy provides general guidance. Where local law or collective agreements provide greater rights or impose different requirements, those provisions prevail. This is not legal advice.
