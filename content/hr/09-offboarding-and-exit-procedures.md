# Offboarding & Exit Procedures

## Purpose
Ensure a respectful, secure, and compliant transition when an employee leaves, protecting people, knowledge, and assets.

## Scope & Definitions
- Applies to resignations, end of contract, and involuntary separations.
- Final pay: Last paycheck including any statutory payments and accrued entitlements per local law.

## Notice & Communication
- Employees should provide written notice per their contract.
- Managers notify HR immediately upon receiving notice.
- HR confirms last working day and communicates next steps to stakeholders.

## Knowledge Transfer & Handover
- Document current projects, status, and key contacts.
- Transfer ownership of shared docs, repos, and tools.
- Update runbooks or SOPs to maintain continuity.

## Assets & Access
- Return company equipment on or before the last day (or per remote return kit instructions).
- IT removes access effective at close of business on the last day (or as instructed by HR).
- Redirect email as appropriate and set an auto‑reply.

## Exit Interviews
- HR schedules an optional exit conversation to gather feedback.
- Feedback is anonymized and shared in aggregate for improvement.

## Final Pay & Documentation
- Final pay timing follows local law; includes accrued PTO payouts where applicable.
- Provide required certificates or separation documents per jurisdiction.

## Manager Responsibilities
- Inform impacted teams/customers of transition plans.
- Ensure handovers are complete before the last day.

## Compliance & Non-Compliance
- Failure to return assets or data may delay final pay or trigger legal action as allowed by local law.

## Exceptions & Escalations
- Legal or security matters are escalated to HR, Legal, and IT immediately.

## FAQ
- Can notice be waived? Sometimes; requires manager and HR approval.
- How are unused PTO days handled? Per local law and company policy.
- What if equipment can’t be returned in person? Use the return kit; HR/IT will assist.
