# Vacation and Paid Time Off (PTO)

## Purpose
Provide clear, fair, and globally consistent guidelines for employees to take paid time off for rest, personal matters, and planned breaks, supporting wellbeing and sustainable performance.

## Scope & Definitions
- Applies to all full‑time employees unless a local contract or collective agreement states otherwise.
- PTO: Paid time allocated for personal vacation, rest, and general time away from work.
- Working day: A day the employee would ordinarily be scheduled to work.

## Eligibility
- Eligibility begins on the first day of employment unless a local probation policy specifies otherwise.
- Part‑time employees receive prorated PTO aligned to their scheduled hours.

## Entitlements / Allowances
- Standard global baseline: 20 working days of PTO per calendar year (or local statutory minimum, whichever is greater).
- Seniority uplift (optional): +1 day at 2 years, +1 day at 4 years, capped at +3 additional days total, where permitted by local law.
- Public holidays are separate from PTO and follow local calendars.
- Carryover: Up to 5 unused days may be carried into the next year; must be used by March 31, unless local law mandates different rules.
- Payout: PTO is generally not paid out except upon separation, in accordance with local law.

## Request / Use Process
1. Submit PTO requests in the HR system at least 10 business days in advance for planned absences.
2. Coordinate with your team to ensure coverage; note handoffs in your request.
3. Managers approve or decline within 5 business days; unresolved requests auto‑escalate to HR.
4. Mark your calendar as OOO and set an email/IM autoresponder once approved.
5. For emergencies or short‑notice requests, notify your manager as soon as possible and log the time retrospectively.

## Approvals & Blackout Periods
- Approval considers team coverage, critical deadlines, and fairness of allocation.
- Function‑specific blackout periods may apply (e.g., quarter‑end). HR must pre‑approve any standing blackout policy.
- Managers should avoid repeated declines for the same employee if equivalent requests from others are approved without clear operational rationale.

## Documentation Requirements
- No documentation required for standard PTO.
- For extended leaves (>15 consecutive working days), provide a coverage plan and contact points.

## Manager Responsibilities
- Review and respond to PTO requests within 5 business days.
- Ensure coverage and equitable access to time off.
- Track team PTO usage to avoid burnout and ensure fairness.

## Compliance & Non-Compliance
- Recording PTO accurately is required. Misreporting time is a policy violation.
- Repeated last‑minute requests without valid reason may be addressed via coaching or performance processes.

## Exceptions & Escalations
- Exceptions to carryover limits or deadlines require HR approval.
- If approval is delayed beyond 5 business days, employees may escalate to HR for resolution.

## FAQ
- How do public holidays interact with PTO? Public holidays do not deduct from PTO.
- Can I take half days? Yes, subject to local rounding rules (e.g., 0.5 day minimum).
- What if my request overlaps with a teammate’s? Managers will balance fairness and business needs.
- Can PTO be negative? Negative balances require prior HR approval and may be disallowed by local law.
- What happens when I leave the company? Remaining PTO is handled per local law (payout or forfeiture).

## Revision History
- 2025-11-01: Version 1.0 – Initial global policy.

## Disclaimer
This global policy provides general guidance. Where local law or collective agreements provide greater rights or impose different requirements, those provisions prevail. This is not legal advice.
