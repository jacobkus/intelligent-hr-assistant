# Working Hours, Attendance & Timekeeping

## Purpose
Ensure consistent expectations for working hours, breaks, and accurate time records to support pay accuracy and compliance.

## Scope & Definitions
- Applies to all employees; specific rules for non‑exempt/hourly employees may differ per local law.
- Standard hours: Typical weekly working time (e.g., 40 hours) unless local contract specifies otherwise.

## Standard Hours & Breaks
- Standard schedule set by team; follow local break and rest requirements.
- Flexible start/stop is encouraged with agreed core collaboration hours.

## Attendance
- Be present and available during agreed working hours.
- Notify your manager of delays or absences as soon as possible.

## Timekeeping
- Hourly/non‑exempt employees must record actual hours worked daily in the HRIS.
- Do not work off‑the‑clock. All time must be recorded and compensated per local rules.
- Salaried/exempt employees track PTO and leaves but not daily hours unless required locally.

## Overtime & Pre‑Approval
- Overtime requires prior manager approval except in emergencies.
- Overtime is compensated or time‑off‑in‑lieu per local law and company policy.

## Manager Responsibilities
- Communicate schedules and approval processes.
- Review and approve time entries timely to ensure accurate payroll.

## Compliance & Non-Compliance
- Falsifying or omitting time entries is a serious violation.
- Repeated tardiness or unapproved absences may trigger corrective action.

## Exceptions & Escalations
- Requests for alternative schedules or accommodations should be made to the manager and HR.

## FAQ
- Do I need to track breaks? Track when required by local law or system configuration.
- Can I bank overtime as time off? Where permitted locally and approved in advance.
- How are holidays handled? Per local calendars; see PTO policy for interaction.

## Revision History

## Disclaimer
This global policy provides general guidance. Where local law or collective agreements provide greater rights or impose different requirements, those provisions prevail. This is not legal advice.
