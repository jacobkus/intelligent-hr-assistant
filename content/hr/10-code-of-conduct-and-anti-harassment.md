# Code of Conduct & Anti‑Harassment Policy

## Purpose
Foster a safe, inclusive workplace where every person is treated with dignity and respect, free from harassment, discrimination, and retaliation.

## Scope & Principles
- Applies to all employees, contractors, interns, and visitors.
- Covers all work‑related contexts: offices, remote settings, events, online tools, and travel.
- We uphold integrity, professionalism, inclusion, and compliance with laws.

## Prohibited Conduct (Non‑Exhaustive)
- Harassment: Unwelcome conduct (verbal, physical, visual) based on protected traits.
- Discrimination: Unfair treatment based on protected traits.
- Sexual harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances, requests, or conduct; hostile environment.
- Bullying/abuse: Threats, intimidation, or humiliation.
- Retaliation: Any adverse action for reporting or participating in an investigation.

## Reporting & Support
- Report concerns to HR, your manager, or via the anonymous hotline where available.
- Urgent safety issues: Contact local authorities and inform HR when safe.
- Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent possible.

## Investigations
- Reports are reviewed promptly and impartially by trained personnel.
- Parties will have an opportunity to share information.
- Findings inform appropriate remedial actions.

## Consequences
- Violations may result in corrective action up to and including termination of employment.
- Contractors or visitors may have engagement terminated and access revoked.

## Bystander Guidance
- If safe, intervene or disrupt inappropriate behavior; otherwise, report promptly.
- Support colleagues who raise concerns; avoid gossip or speculation.

## Manager Responsibilities
- Model expected behaviors and address issues immediately.
- Protect employees from retaliation and ensure fair treatment.

## Training & Awareness
- Regular training is required; completion is tracked by HR.

## FAQ
- Can I report anonymously? Where the hotline is available, yes; otherwise speak to HR for confidentiality options.
- What if I’m unsure behavior violates policy? Ask HR; early conversations can prevent harm.
- Will I be informed of outcomes? HR shares information consistent with privacy and legal requirements.

## Revision History
