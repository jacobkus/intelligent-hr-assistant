# Parental Leave Policy

## Purpose
Support new parents—birth, adoption, or foster placement—with paid time away from work and a structured, equitable process for taking leave and returning to work.

## Scope & Definitions
- Applies to all employees globally; local statutory rights prevail where they offer greater benefits.
- Parental leave includes maternity, paternity, adoption, and partner leave.
- Primary caregiver: The person with primary day‑to‑day responsibility for the child.

## Eligibility
- Eligibility begins after 6 months of continuous service unless local law grants earlier access.
- Part‑time employees are eligible on a prorated basis.

## Entitlements / Allowances
- Global baseline (where permitted):
  - Primary caregiver: Up to 12 weeks paid parental leave.
  - Secondary caregiver/partner: Up to 4 weeks paid parental leave.
- Unpaid leave: Additional unpaid time may be requested up to local statutory maximums.
- Benefits continuation: Health and other benefits continue during paid leave; unpaid periods follow local regulations and plan rules.
- Public holidays during leave do not extend paid leave entitlements unless required locally.

## Request / Use Process
1. Notify your manager and HR as early as possible (recommended: 12 weeks prior to expected start date).
2. Submit a leave plan in the HR system including expected dates and caregiver designation.
3. Provide required documentation (e.g., medical confirmation, adoption papers) per local law.
4. Create a handover plan for responsibilities and designate points of contact.
5. Confirm any phased return or flexible arrangements with your manager and HR.

## Approvals & Blackout Periods
- Parental leave is a protected leave; approval is based on eligibility and documentation, not business timing.
- Blackout periods do not apply to parental leave.

## Documentation Requirements
- Proof of birth/adoption/placement per local standards.
- Any medical certificates or statutory forms required in your jurisdiction.

## Manager Responsibilities
- Support planning for coverage and reintegration.
- Maintain confidentiality and a supportive, non‑discriminatory environment.
- Avoid any adverse action related to leave. Consult HR for compliance guidance.

## Return‑to‑Work
- Employees may request a phased return (reduced schedule) or temporary flexible hours, subject to role feasibility and local law.
- Provide at least 2 weeks’ notice of return date changes where feasible.
- Job protection follows local laws; the company aims to return employees to the same or a comparable role.

## Compliance & Non-Compliance
- Discrimination or retaliation related to parental leave is strictly prohibited.
- Misuse of leave or documentation may result in corrective action.

## Exceptions & Escalations
- Complex cases (e.g., multiple births, extended medical recovery) should be escalated to HR for tailored support and accommodations.

## FAQ
- Is parental leave available for adoption or foster placement? Yes, with appropriate documentation.
- Can leave be split into non‑consecutive blocks? Where permitted by local law and operationally feasible.
- Are benefits maintained during leave? Yes during paid leave; unpaid leave follows plan and local rules.
- Can I extend my leave? Request additional unpaid time subject to local law and approval.

## Revision History
- 2025-11-01: Version 1.0 – Initial global parental leave policy.

## Disclaimer
This global policy provides general guidance. Where local law or collective agreements provide greater rights or impose different requirements, those provisions prevail. This is not legal advice.
