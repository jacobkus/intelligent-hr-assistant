# Sick Leave Policy

## Purpose
Enable employees to recover from illness or attend to medical needs without undue financial or job security concerns, while maintaining business continuity.

## Scope & Definitions
- Applies to all employees unless local law or agreements specify different entitlements.
- Sick leave: Paid time off for illness, injury, medical appointments, or caregiving for immediate family where permitted.
- Immediate family: Spouse/partner, child, parent, or as defined by local law.

## Eligibility
- Eligibility begins on the first day of employment unless local regulation differs.
- Part‑time employees receive prorated entitlements.

## Entitlements / Allowances
- Global baseline: Up to 10 paid working days per year (or local statutory minimum if greater).
- Short‑term illness (1–3 days): Self‑certification allowed unless patterns indicate misuse.
- Longer illness (>3 consecutive working days): Medical note may be required, subject to local law.
- Carryover: Unused sick leave does not carry over unless required by local law.

## Request / Use Process
1. Notify your manager as soon as practicable (ideally before start of the workday).
2. Record sick time in the HR system on the same day or as soon as feasible.
3. For planned appointments, request time in advance and mark as “medical appointment”.
4. Provide updates for absences beyond 3 days and expected return date.

## Approvals & Blackout Periods
- Sick leave is not subject to blackout periods.
- Managers may require scheduling adjustments for planned appointments to minimize disruption where reasonable.

## Documentation Requirements
- Self‑certification for up to 3 consecutive days, unless local law differs.
- Medical certificate for absences exceeding 3 days or when patterns suggest misuse, consistent with privacy laws.

## Manager Responsibilities
- Encourage employees to prioritize health and avoid working while unwell.
- Keep absence details confidential; only necessary parties are informed.
- Monitor patterns and consult HR for support when needed.

## Compliance & Non-Compliance
- Falsifying sick leave is a serious policy violation.
- Medical information must be handled in compliance with privacy regulations.

## Exceptions & Escalations
- Caregiving leave may be available where permitted; consult HR for local rules.
- Escalate complex or extended cases to HR for accommodations and return‑to‑work planning.

## FAQ
- Can I take partial‑day sick leave? Yes; record the hours in the HR system.
- Do I need a doctor’s note? Only for longer absences or per local law.
- Is mental health covered? Yes; treat mental health like physical health.
- Can I work while sick? Avoid working while unwell; prioritize recovery.

## Revision History
- 2025-11-01: Version 1.0 – Initial global sick leave policy.

## Disclaimer
This global policy provides general guidance. Where local law or collective agreements provide greater rights or impose different requirements, those provisions prevail. This is not legal advice.
